# PISA Example
 I prepared this repository for students and academicians in the Institute of Statistics, Operation Research and Mathematics at the Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra. 
 I will mention parametric and non-parametric multivariate hypothesis tests for the Erasmus+ Staff Teaching program in Nitra, Slovakia.
 We will use the PISA Example dataset to perform these hypothesis tests. 

This dataset consists of five columns (variables) and 1500 rows (students) for five different countries (Switzerland, Czechia, Türkiye, France, and Italy).
We randomly sample 300 students for each country. Our variables are below:

- Nation
- Gender
- PISA Mathematic Score
- PISA Reading Score
- PISA Science Score

  We use this data to compare PISA scores according to students' gender and nation.
  You can download this dataset as the .sav or .csv file.
